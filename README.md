# Rustifier

Rustifier is a tool designed to quickly set up a complete Yazelix environment, integrating Zellij, Yazi, Helix, WezTerm, and Nushell. It offers an easy, opinionated setup with the option to include additional useful Rust-based terminal utilities.

## Todo List

- [x] Install just with cargo
- [x] Check and fix links
- [ ] Fix Helix installation
- [ ] Update Yazelix README
- [ ] Create Yazelix video

## Compatibility

- **Full compatibility**: Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Debian, etc.)
- **Partial compatibility**: Other Linux distributions (may require manual WezTerm installation)

## Prerequisites

- A Linux distribution (Debian-based recommended for full compatibility)
- Bash shell

Note: Rust and Just will be automatically installed if not already present on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/luccahuguet/rustifier.git
   cd rustifier
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation. You'll be asked to choose between a basic or expanded installation.

## Project Structure

The project uses a modular structure with separate justfiles for different components:

- `setup.sh`: The main setup script that ensures Rust and Just are installed
- `main.just`: The main justfile that orchestrates the installation process
- `src/install_rust.just`: Handles Rust installation
- `src/config_wez.just`: Configures WezTerm
- `src/basic.just`: Installs core components
- `src/expanded.just`: Installs core components and additional utilities

## WezTerm Configuration

WezTerm configuration lies in a separate repository: [wez-files](https://github.com/yourusername/wez-files), but the installation process will clone this repository and set up WezTerm to use these configuration files for you.
